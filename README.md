# io-android-audio-comb-filter

This project consists of a simple Android Application that implements an algorithm for a Variable Order Comb Filter. 
The Application reads a short WAV file from its resources, reproduces it and filters it, using a toggle button to turn the filtering on or off. It also uses a slider to select the order of the Comb Filter.
